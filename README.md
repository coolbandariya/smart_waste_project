# Smart Waste Collection & Route Optimisation

<p align="center"><strong>Prediction → priority → routing</strong><br/>An end-to-end decision pipeline connecting machine-learning forecasts to vehicle-routing decisions.</p>

> **Status:** engineering prototype using synthetic IoT-style data. This demonstrates the decision pipeline; it is not evidence of a live municipal deployment.

## Engineering snapshot

**Problem:** collection decisions need to connect predicted bin state with operational urgency and vehicle constraints.

**Pipeline:** IoT-style time series → feature engineering → Random Forest prediction → continuous priority scoring → Google OR-Tools routing → Streamlit/Folium decision surface.

**Technical proof:** time-series features · Random Forest regression · 0–100 priority scoring · CVRP optimisation · geospatial dashboard.

## Why the pipeline matters

The project deliberately connects stages that are often presented as separate demos: model output becomes a prioritisation signal, prioritisation becomes an optimisation input, and the resulting route is exposed for inspection.

## Boundaries

The data is synthetic and the routing environment is simulated. Model accuracy, route quality and operational savings should therefore be evaluated as engineering experiments rather than real-world impact.

## 🌟 Key Features

* **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**: Generates and processes IoT time-series data, engineering key lag features and rolling averages.
* **ML Fill Level Prediction**: Predicts future bin capacity levels using a Random Forest Regressor model.
* **Dynamic Priority Scoring**: Calculates a normalised 0–100 priority score using mathematical membership curves taking fill %, time elapsed, and bin criticality into account.
* **Route Optimisation (CVRP)**: Solves the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem using Google OR-Tools to minimise travel distances while honouring truck capacity limits.
* **Interactive Dashboard**: Features a live Streamlit interface with Folium map rendering, dynamic priority thresholds, and route visualisation.
